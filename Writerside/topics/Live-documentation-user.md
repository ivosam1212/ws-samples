# Live documentation - Product

In addition to the examples in the previous sections, I also include a link to my contribution in product documentation. The [**Pulse**](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/pulse) section in Adjust's Help Center is of my authorship, including all its sub-pages.

I followed the company's style guide and practices to create all articles. Here is a list of articles documenting the Pulse product:
