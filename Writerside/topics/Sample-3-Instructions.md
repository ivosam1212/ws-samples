## Tic-Tac-Toe description
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game designed for **two players**. It consists of a nine-space (3x3) grid where the players need to fill three consecutive symbols, **Xs** for one player and **Os** for the other. The first player to complete the sequence wins the game.

## Rules
There are some rules to consider when playing Tic-Tac-Toe. Players must:

- Choose and use *only* one symbol per game
- Draw their symbol once per turn
- Draw *only* on blank spaces


## Instructions
To play Tic-Tac-Toe:

1. The first player marks one of the spaces with their selected symbol.
2. The second player marks one of the remaining blank spaces.
3. Repeat steps one and two until one of the players marks three consecutive spaces. The sequence can be one of the following options:
    * Horizontal
    * Vertical
    * Diagonal

**Note**: If both players fill the grid without marking three consecutive spaces, the game ends in a tie and they can restart it.
